# Journey through the Stars
 2D ASCII roguelike in C with ncurses

vaguely space exploration themed, but I haven't gotten that far yet

based on the tutorial at https://dev.to/ignaoya/the-c-roguelike-tutorial-part-0-the-setup-1pfo but that tutorial is unfinished so I just picked up where it left off

>primitive procedural generation
>simple combat system (speed, armor, damage based)
>logging system
>inventory system
>(sorta lazy) pathfinding system
>dynamic fov
>saving system (in its infancy)
>more stuff to be added
