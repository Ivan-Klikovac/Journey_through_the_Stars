# Journey through the Stars
 2D ASCII roguelike in C with ncurses

Space exploration themed, still early in development.

Based on the tutorial at https://dev.to/ignaoya/the-c-roguelike-tutorial-part-0-the-setup-1pfo. That tutorial is unfinished so I picked up where it left off.

- primitive procedural generation
- simple combat system (speed, armor, damage based)
- logging system
- inventory system
- pathfinding system
- dynamic fov
- saving system (in progress)
- more to be added
